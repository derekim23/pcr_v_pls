# PCR v. PLSDA

The reason behind comparing these two methods is to see if any of these can be/should stay integrated into a mission-critical process that invovles reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional biological data and classifying certain biological outcomes. PLSDA, which is implemented using the [mixOmics](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/mixOmics/man/mixOmics.pdf) package, far outperforms PCR which was already being used at the time.

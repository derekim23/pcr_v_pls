# PCR v. PLSDA

The reason behind comparing these two methods is to see if any of these can be/should stay integrated into a mission-critical business process of a client, which invovles reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional biological data and classifying certain biological outcomes. PLSDA, which is implemented using the [mixOmics](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/mixOmics/man/mixOmics.pdf) package, far outperforms PCR which was already being used at the time.

No data is included given the sensitive nature of the project; however, the scripts should work for most regression problems with minor tweaks.

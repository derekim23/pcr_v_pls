# PCR v. PLSDA

The main reason behind comparing these two methods is to see if any of these methods can be integrated into a DARPA process that invovles reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional biological data. Overall, PLSDA, which is implemented using the [mixOmics](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/mixOmics/man/mixOmics.pdf) package, far outperforms PCR.
